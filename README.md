# DevNexus Conference
# Getting Started With Service Workers

This repo contains my slides and code that I used in my presentation. My presentation covered getting started with service workers in a progressive web app.

# How To Use

This repo has a folder for the ```server``` and a folder for the ```client```. The server provides all the data to the frontend client via API calls.  The client is the frontend.

## Starting the Server

First ``cd`` into the server folder.

Second ```npm install```

Third start server with ```node server```

## Starting the Client

First ``cd`` into the client folder.

Second ```npm install```

Third start client with ```npm start```

Fourth open browser and navigate to ```localhost:8080```

## Slides

The slides for my talk are located in the slide folder.
